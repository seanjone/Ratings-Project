B00L1WUD58,Glenda Birdow,4,Enjoyable show with great storylines.
B00L2GPYKW,John E. Klintz "Audiophile",5,This was recently on &#34;Masterpiece Mystery&#34; on PBS; we saw the first episode but missed the rest.  Definitely worth the purchase and the time to watch.
B00L2GPYKW,Liz Hart,5,I love PBS and I adore David Tenant. Had my attention for the whole time. I would highly recommend.
B00L33AF7G,Amazon Customer,5,Love it!  As usual it's good entertainment!!
B00L33AF7G,Anne E. Heinzer "achariane",5,Fantastic! I love the plots and the cast is first class.
B00L33AF7G,Kenneth M. Mulmat "Ken",5,It is interesting to watch Jane become more interested in having a child since she thinks she is pregnant. The first episode was also sad with the memorial for Frost. A great actor and character was lost to the show and all who follow the two BFFs.
B00L33AF7G,Molly "Molly Rossiter",5,It's hard to go wrong with Jane and Maura - they're the ultimate team.
B00L33AF7G,Pete,4,The show continues to be good entertainment. The personal issues of both Rizzoli and Isles are fun. The crime fighting plot is entertaining. The loss of one of their teammates in this first episode is a surprise (don't want to spoil the plot).
B00L86ZKAK,Amazon Customer,5,Love this series. Cannot wait for the rest of the season. Though I must say I was pretty angry when it wasn't the &#34;mini series&#34; it was billed as originally and I had to wait almost a year for more!
B00L86ZKAK,Capt'n Bub "seau2007",2,And another Stephen King story. That says it all.
B00L86ZKAK,Carla tamari,3,So far a bit lack luster the plot is very slow.  But it is my sort of show .you know all metaphysical and hyperdimensional and stuff. So we will continue to tune in and buy when we have to .
B00L86ZKAK,charles ackley,5,I never watched this show tell this year about a month ago so I seen that amazon was going to stream season two was all over it. the show keeps my attention from start to finish and that means a lot keep up the good work amazon and do more like this like all of cbs shows please
B00L86ZKAK,chinagirl "ncchinagirl",5,**Bit of a Spoiler**Looking forward to learning more about this other world where Junior's mother is at the moment. It is very intriguing that she's not dead and that years ago she saw the future of the dome.Watch it religiously every Friday! I love anything Stephen King!
B00L86ZKAK,Darren Slawson,3,The season so far is crazy people coming together that were mortal enemies previously doesn't make sense and the time frame doesn't make sense at all either
B00L86ZKAK,Dave,1,Last season was so much better.
